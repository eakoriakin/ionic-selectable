## Commit Message Guidelines

We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages should be formatted. This leads to readable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history. Our format closely resembles Angular's [commit message guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit).

### Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). A commit message consists of a **header**, **body** and **footer**.  The header has a **type**, **scope** and **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

### Revert

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

### Type

If the prefix is `feat`, `fix` or `perf`, it will appear in the changelog. However if there is any [BREAKING CHANGE](#footer), the commit will always appear in the changelog.

Must be one of the following:

* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **test**: Adding missing tests
* **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

### Scope

The scope can be anything specifying place of the commit change. Usually it will refer to a component but it can also refer to a utility. For example `action-sheet`, `button`, `css`, `menu`, `nav`, etc. If you make multiple commits for the same component, please keep the naming of this component consistent. For example, if you make a change to navigation and the first commit is `fix(nav)`, you should continue to use `nav` for any more commits related to navigation. As a general rule, if you're modifying a component use the name of the folder.

### Subject

The subject contains succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* do not capitalize first letter
* do not place a period `.` at the end
* entire length of the commit message must not go over 50 characters
* describe what the commit does, not what issue it relates to or fixes
* **be brief, yet descriptive** - we should have a good understanding of what the commit does by reading the subject

### Body

Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer

The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to
reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

### Examples

Does not appear in the generated changelog:

```
docs(changelog): update steps to update
```

Appears under "Features" header, toast subheader:

```
feat(toast): add 'buttons' property
```

Appears under "Bug Fixes" header, skeleton-text subheader, with a link to issue #28:

```
fix(skeleton-text): use proper color when animated

closes #28
```

Appears under "Performance Improvements" header, and under "Breaking Changes" with the breaking change explanation:

```
perf(css): remove all css utility attributes

BREAKING CHANGE: The CSS utility attributes have been removed. Use CSS classes instead.
```

Appears under "Breaking Changes" with the breaking change explanation:

```
refactor(animations): update to new animation system

BREAKING CHANGE:

Removes the old animation system to use the new Ionic animations.
```

The following commit and commit `667ecc1` do not appear in the changelog if they are under the same release. If not, the revert commit appears under the "Reverts" header.

```
revert: feat(skeleton-text): add animated property

This reverts commit 667ecc1654a317a13331b17617d973392f415f02.
